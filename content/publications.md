## Research Interests

My research interests lie in **Numerical Linear Algebra**, with a particular focus on the theoretical and algorithmic aspects of **Tensor Decompositions**.

I am specifically working on the following topics:

* **Tensor Train Decomposition**  
I investigate efficient algorithms and properties of the **Tensor Train (TT) format**, which is a powerful tool for breaking down high-dimensional tensors into lower-order components to mitigate the curse of dimensionality.

* **Optimization on Tensors**  
I am interested in solving **optimization problems** involving tensor structures. This includes developing numerical algorithms for finding optimal low-rank approximations and handling tensor completion problems.

* **Generalization of Matrix Structures**  
A key part of my theoretical research focuses on extending fundamental matrix concepts to higher-order tensors.
