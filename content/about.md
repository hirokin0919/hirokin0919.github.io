## Biography

**Hiroki Takeda** (武田 博樹)

I am currently a first-year Master's student (M1) at Osaka University, Japan.
My academic background is in **Mathematics** (B.Sc.), and I am currently applying mathematical structures to **Information Science**.

I have a strong passion for **Numerical Linear Algebra**. My goal is to develop efficient algorithms for high-dimensional data analysis by bridging the gap between pure mathematics (algebraic structures) and numerical computation.

I mainly use the **Julia** language for my research and numerical experiments.
